			If you see a bright pink box at the top of the page saying <b>'Connection to
			ardopcf lost. Try reloading this page.'</b>, then this page is unable to establish
			a connection with ardopcf, or that connection has been closed.  This can occur
			for a number of reasons.  This will be displayed if the ardopcf program is
			terminated (intentionally or not).  If you are displaying this page on a
			device (computer, table, phone, etc.) other that the one that is running the
			ardopcf program, then this can also be caused by a problem with the network (often
			WiFi) connection between them.  It is normal for this message to very briefly
			flash at the top of this page when it first loads.
			</p><p>
			A few different devices can view copies of this Web GUI for that same running
			ardopcf instance.  However, ardopcf will refuse additional connections if too
			many copies try to connect simultaneously.
			</p><p>
			The top of this page shows the current <b>'ProtocolMode'</b>.  This will be one of
			'ARQ', 'FEC', or 'RXO'.  Next is shown the current Ardop protocol <b>'State'</b>
			This may be:
			<dl>
				<dt>'DISC'</dt><dd>disconnected</dd>
				<dt>'FECRcv'</dt><dd>receiving Forward Error Correction (FEC) frame</dd>
				<dt>'FECSend'</dt><dd>sending FEC frame</dd>
				<dt>'ISS'</dt><dd>station is the Information Sending Station</dd>
				<dt>'IRS'</dt><dd>station is the Information Receiving Station</dd>
				<dt>'IRStoISS'</dt><dd>transition from 'IRS' to 'ISS'</dd>
				<dt>'IDLE'</dt><dd>idle</dd>
			</dl>
			</p><p>
			The next blank line will show <b>'PTT'</b> when transmitting and <b>'Channel Busy'</b> when
			the busy detector detects a signal within Ardop's current bandwidth settings.
			</p><p>
			The next line shows the value of <b>MYCALL</b> and the callsign of the station you
			are connected to or sending Connection Requests (ConReq) to.  MYCALL is
			normally set by the Host program such as Pat Winlink or gARIM.  This should
			be your callsign.  If it has not been set, then it will show <b>'(MYCALL NOT
			SET)'</b>.
			</p><p>
			The <b>spectrum and waterfall plots</b> show from about 300 to 2700 Hz.  If this is
			narrower than the receive filter of your radio, high and/or low pitched audio
			that you hear from your radio may not be visible on these plots.  The thin
			black line in the center of the waterfall display is at 1500 Hz, the center
			frequency for Ardop signals.  The gray or pink lines on each side of the plots
			indicate the approximate edges of the currently selected ARQ bandwidth (200,
			500, 1000, or 2000 Hz wide).  These lines are not labeled, but their location
			relative to the total bandwidth should make it obvious which of these bandwidths
			they represent.
			</p><p>
			The levels shown in the spectrum and waterfall displays are log scale (dB),
			and a very slow automatic gain control is used to try to clearly show the
			relative power levels of signals and noise detected in the available audio.
			User adjustable <b>'Plot Averaging'</b> may optionally be applied.  Averaging smooths
			out the appearance of noise, which may make it easier to distinguish low
			power signals.  However, it also makes the plots less responsive to quickly
			changing received signals.  If the busy detector fails to recognize a signal
			that you can see or hear within the Ardop bandwidth you intend to use, you
			should not attempt to establish a connection at this time on this frequency,
			because you may interfere with the existing signal.
			</p><p>
			<b>'Plot Scale'</b> may be used to increase the size of all of the plots.  This does
			not change the amount of data being used for the plots.  It just magnifies them.
			</p><p>
			Scaling of data for plotting, include averaging, does NOT affect the 'Rcv Level'
			indicator, the busy detector, or ardopcf's abilility to detect or decode data.
			These adjustments are purely for display purposes.
			</p><p>
			The <b>constellation plot</b> provides a visual indicator of the quality of the most
			recently received PSK/QAM frame.  The display shown for FSK frames provides
			less information, but may still be somewhat useful.
			</p><p>
			The <b>'Quality'</b> value provides an indication of the quality of the most recently
			received frame, whether correctly decoded or not.  Ideally, this value would be
			independent of ardopcf's ability to demodulate and decode the signal, but since it uses
			intermediate values from the demodulators, this is not the case.  Some frame types
			typically require higher 'Quality' values than others to ensure correct decoding.
			</p><p>
			The <b>'RS Errors'</b> value provides a measure of ardopcf's level of success in
			accurately demodulating and decoding the most recently received frame.  All data frame
			types, as well as some control frame types, use Reed Solomon (RS) error correction to
			allow the frame to be correctly decoded even if a limited number of bytes were
			initially decoded incorrectly.  By reporting how many bytes of the frame had to be
			corrected in this way, compared to the maximum number of such corrections the frame
			type supports, the level of success of the demodulators can be inferred.  A small
			number of errors indicates a high level of success at demodulating the raw signal.
			When a frame cannot be correctly decoded, the number of RS errors shown will always be
			one more than the nuumber that could have been corrected.  At least this many errors
			were present, or else they would have been corrected.  It is not possible to determine
			how many additional errors may have been present.  A high number of RS Errors may be an
			indication of poor quality of the received signal, a deficiency in ardopcf's
			demodulators and decoders, or some combination of the two.
			</p><p>
			The <b>'Rcv Level'</b> graph shows the percentage of full scale used by the received
			audio on a linear scale.  If this level is too high, the audio will be clipped,
			making it harder for ardopcf to decode received signals.  The 'Rcv Level'
			indicates the combined amplitude of everything in your radio's receive
			bandwidth, and is thus not influenced by the Ardop bandwidth settings indicated
			on the spectrum and waterfall plots.  A strong signal outside of the Ardop
			bandwidth can still cause audio clipping.
			</p><p>
			A warning message is shown when <b>excessive audio levels</b> are detected.  This
			message will disappear a few seconds after audio amplitudes drop to more reasonable
			levels.  Low to moderate audio levels seem to usually work well.  However, audio
			levels that are too low may also make it more difficult for ardopcf to decode received
			signals.  A warning message is shown when received audio is very low.  However, if
			noise levels are low, <u>the <b>'Low Audio'</b> warning may be ignored when no signals
			are present.</u>  If the 'Low Audio' warning remains on when ardop signals are present,
			then increasing the audio level may improve decoding.  Increasing your received audio
			level may also help if you see faint indication of possible ardop signals centered on
			the waterfall display, but ardopcf does not appear to be detecting these signals.
			</p><p>
			Received audio levels are dependent on the actual strength of the received signal,
			on some of your radio's settings, and on the 'microphone' settings for your computer's
			soundcard.  Details of how to adjust these various settings depends on the model of
			radio you are using and on what operating system your computer uses.
			</p><p>
			The <b>'RX Frame Type'</b> and <b>'TX Frame Type'</b> displays show what Ardop frame
			type is being received or sent respectively.  These values also persist for a short
			time after a frame has been received or sent.  <u>In some cases, ardopcf attempts to
			decode a frame that is not really there.</u>  This is most likely to occur when your
			radio is receiving a lot of noise or a non-ardop digital signal.  While receiving,
			the 'RX Frame Type' is initially shown with a yellow background.  If this frame is
			not successfully decoded, the background will change to red.  If it is successfully
			decoded, the background will change to green.  The 'TX Frame Type' is normally shown
			with a white background, but a light green background is used when sending a DataACK
			frame telling the other station that you correctly received some data.  A light pink
			background is used when sending a DataNAK frame telling the other station that you
			were unable to decode some received data.
			</p><p>
			The <b>'TX DriveLevel'</b> slider linearly scales the amplitude of the audio sent to
			your radio by ardopcf.  This, along with your radio's settings and the 'speaker'
			settings for your computer's soundcard, influences the strength and quality of
			your transmitted radio signal.  By default, this slider control will be set to to
			100 when ardopcf is first started, though the --hostcommands option may be used to
			specify a different initial DRIVELEVEL.  You may want to adjust your radio and
			soudcard settings to levels that allow you to use this convenient slider control
			to make final adjustments to your transmit audio level.
			</p><p>
			Reduced audio amplitude can be used to <b>decrease the RF power</b> of your
			transmitted signals when using a single sideband radio transmitter.  In addition to
			limiting your power to only what is required to carry out the desired communications
			[for US Amateur operators this is required by Part 97.313(a)], reducing your power
			output may also be necessary if your radio cannot handle extended transmissions at
			its full rated power when using high duty cycle digital modes.  While sending data,
			Ardop can have a very high duty cycle as it sends long data frames with only brief
			breaks to hear short DataACK or DataNAK frames from the other station.
			</p><p>
			If the output audio is too loud, your radio's <b>Automatic Level Control (ALC)</b>
			will adjust this audio before using it to modulate the RF signal.  This adjustment
			may distort the signal making it more difficult for other stations to correctly
			receive your transmissions.  Some frame types used by Ardop may be more sensitive
			to these distortions than others.
			</p><p>
			Details of how to monitor the action of your radio's ALC, and how to adjust
			your radio and soundcard settings depend on the model of radio you are using
			and on what operating system your computer uses.  On some radios, the maximum
			output audio levels that can be used without causing problems may depend on the
			band of operation as well as other radio settings.  So, ALC action should be
			checked after changing frequencies or making other changes to the radio's settings.
			On some radios, appropriate audio levels are highly dependent on the power output
			settings of the radio, while on other radios they are mostly independent of these
			settings.
			</p><p>
			The <b>'Send2Tone'</b> button causes ardopcf to transmit a 5 second two tone signal
			similar, but longer than what is used as the leader at the start of all Ardop
			frames.  This will not be sent if the Protocol 'STATE', as shown near the top
			of this page, is not 'DISC' for disconnected.  An alert is displayed for this
			failure.
			</p><p>
			The <b>'SendID'</b> button causes ardopcf to transmit an ID frame containing your
			callsign.  If MYCALL has not been set, such that '(MYCALL NOT SET)', then this
			frame cannot be sent, and an alert is displayed instead.  Similarly, this will
			not be sent if the Protocol 'STATE', as shown near the top of this page, is
			not 'DISC' for disconnected.  An alert is displayed for this failure as well.
			If a Maidenhead grid square indicating your location has been set by the Host
			program, this is also included in an ID frame.
			</p><p>
			Either of these transmissions may be useful for antenna tuning or for making
			initial adjustments to DRIVELEVEL settings.  However, <u>the various frame types
			sent by ardopcf do not all produce the same audio power levels.</u>  This is a
			known issue that will hopefully be improved in a future release.  For now, this
			means that additional adjustments may be useful based on actual data transmissions.
			</p><p>
			The various items displayed here can change quickly during an Ardop ARQ
			connection.  The debug log file created by ardopcf contains most of this same
			information and more, though it does not contain data comparable to the waterfall
			or constellation plots.  Reviewing the contents of the log file may be of interest
			after an exchange that failed, or during which you saw something that seemed unusual.
			The <b>'Show Log'</b> button also provides a list of most of what has been displayed.
			This log window shows less detail than the debug log file, but provides a
			convenient way to review what has occured.  Some entries in the log window are
			timestamped.  These timestamps use the clock of the device you are viewing this
			page on, which may be different from the clock on the device that is running
			the ardopcf program.  Due to this, times shown in the log window may be slightly
			different from those written to the debug log file.
			</p><p>
			The <b>'Clear Log'</b> button (visible only when the log window is visible) may be used
			to discard the contents of this window.  This might be useful before initiating
			a new connection.  The 'Clear Log' button does not influence what is written to
			the debug log file.
